  <h3 style="font-size: 1.15rem; color: #2c3e50;">1. What Western Media Doesn't Tell You</h3>
  <h4 style="font-size: 1.05rem; color: #555; margin-top: 16px;">The News Only Shows 1% of Asia</h4>

  <p>What does Asia look like in Western news? Typhoons, tsunamis, earthquakes. Terrorism, conflict, dictatorships. Poverty, disease, chaos. That's the Asia Westerners see on TV.</p>

  <p>But <strong>this is less than 1% of Asia.</strong> News reports incidents. Daily life isn't news. Millions of people peacefully commuting in Bangkok isn't news. Lost items being returned 100% of the time in Tokyo isn't news.</p>

  <p>I've traveled to 100+ countries. Europe, the Americas, Africa, Oceania&mdash;I've been to all of them. Objectively speaking, <strong>Asia is the safest continent I've ever traveled.</strong></p>

  <p>European pickpockets, South American muggers, African scammers. These problems are significantly less common in Asia. Of course, crime exists in Asia too. But <strong>crime targeting tourists</strong> is far rarer than in Europe.</p>

    <ul style="margin: 8px 0 0; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Japan's</strong> crime rate is among the world's lowest. Lose your wallet and it comes back.</li>
      <li><strong>Singapore</strong> is a city-state so clean it even regulates chewing gum.</li>
      <li><strong>Thailand</strong> welcomes 40 million tourists annually.</li>
      <li><strong>Vietnam</strong> welcomes American tourists. The war ended 50 years ago.</li>
    </ul>

  <h4 style="font-size: 1.05rem; color: #555; margin-top: 16px;">Travel Twice as Much for the Same Money</h4>

  <p><strong>First, cost.</strong> Average daily expense in Europe: &euro;100-150. In Asia: $30-50. For the same two-week trip, Europe costs $3,000, Asia costs $1,000.</p>

  <p><strong>Second, food.</strong> A &euro;15-30 meal at a European restaurant costs $2-5 in Asia. And that's Michelin Guide-recognized street food.</p>

  <p><strong>Third, diversity.</strong> Europe feels samey. Cathedrals, plazas, cafes. Asia is completely different from country to country. Japanese minimalism, Indian chaos, Thai smiles, Chinese scale.</p>

    <strong>From a 100+-Country Traveler</strong><br>
    I've been pickpocketed in Paris. Attempted in Barcelona, too, and Rome. But in 30 Asian countries&mdash;not once.
