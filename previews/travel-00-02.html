  <h4 style="font-size: 1.05rem; color: #555; margin-top: 16px;">Set a Daily Budget and Your Trip Takes Shape</h4>

  <p>If you're planning a trip of a month or longer, think in terms of <strong>daily budget</strong> rather than total cost. $100, $150, $200. This single number determines where you'll go, how you'll get around, and how long you'll stay.</p>

  <p>Your daily budget covers accommodation, food, local transport, and sightseeing. The key is to <strong>calculate long-distance transportation separately</strong>&mdash;flights, buses, and trains between cities. You can adjust lodging and meals anywhere, but inter-city and cross-border travel costs vary dramatically by region and method.</p>

  <p>Cost of living differs by region. Iceland and Norway top the scale, followed by Western Europe, North America, Australia, and Japan. Eastern Europe and South America fall in the middle, while Southeast Asia, India, and Nepal are the most affordable. But <strong>every region offers both expensive and budget options.</strong></p>

  <p>Money and time are a trade-off. Overnight buses save on accommodation but drain your energy. Flying saves time but costs money. And <strong>flying lets you leap across distances, making zigzag itineraries possible.</strong></p>

    <ul style="margin: 8px 0 0; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li>Budget flights in Europe often start at $20&ndash;30</li>
      <li>Search for flights in two places: Skyscanner + Google Flights</li>
      <li>Use hub airports (Istanbul, Dubai, Addis Ababa) as stepping stones</li>
      <li>The 5-hour rule: under 5 hours, ground transport often makes more sense</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>From a 100+ Country Traveler</strong><br>
    When budgeting, decide "how much can I spend per day" before "where should I go." If you calculate transportation separately, $150 a day lets you travel almost anywhere in the world.
